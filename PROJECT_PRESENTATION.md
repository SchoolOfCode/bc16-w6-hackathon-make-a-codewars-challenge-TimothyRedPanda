# Timothy's Kata

A kata created by Timothy for the enjoyment and puzzlement of his fellow bootcampers.



## Initial Planning Stage

- What style of Kata am I looking to produce?

- Maths, Logic or Word Games to name a few. There are many more types but these are the main ones I am considering right off the bat.

- When I have decided on a style of problem what level do I want to aim for?

- Is it going to be really hard but just one or will it be split into varying difficulties? What level of problem can I myself write within my skill set.

- Will I wright my own problem completely from scratch or will I take a famous Logic problem and put my own spin on it - so it can be solved programmatically.

## Answers

#### Style of Kata

I am leaning more towards a logic problem as these are the ones I enjoy solving myself.
I have to be careful that focus creep doesn't become a thing. The logic problem has to fit within the timescale but be hard enough to be enjoyable and challenging.

#### Level I am aiming for

It would be best to aim for a harder kata that is more challenging than different levels of kata. This way I can focus down on planning and testing the one 
really well thought out kata. This again will help in limiting focus creep.

#### My own logic problem or a famous logic problem with my own spin on it.

I am going to do some evening research on logic problems - as in outside the coding space and narrow down the anwser to this one.

## Narrowing it down -

- Logic Problem

- One challenging but enjoyable Kata

- Famous logic problem with a programmatic spin on it.

- The famous logic problem decision may change after research 

- I have a lot of non-programmatic logic books at home - so this is a good research start.

-Once the initial stage is done - I just have to
focus on writing the tests and the coding will fall into place.
